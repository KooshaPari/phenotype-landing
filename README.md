# phenotype-landing

Monorepo of Phenotype org public landing sites (Astro + Bun), consolidated from individual repos via `git subtree` (squashed merges; reversible on a branch).

## Layout

All deployable sites live under `sites/<name>/`. Each directory is an independent Astro (or static) package with its own `package.json`, lockfile, and CI in that subtree.

| Path | Site / purpose |
|------|----------------|
| `sites/agileplus-landing` | AgilePlus product landing |
| `sites/byteport-landing` | BytePort **marketing** landing (not the BytePort app repo) |
| `sites/hwledger-landing` | HW Ledger landing |
| `sites/phenokits-landing` | Phenokits catalog landing |
| `sites/projects-landing` | Projects hub landing |
| `sites/tasken-landing` | Tasken task orchestration landing |
| `sites/tracera-landing` | Tracera requirements traceability landing |
| `sites/thegent-landing` | TheGent landing |
| `sites/odin-landing` | Odin static landing (HTML/CSS, no Astro build) |

**Not absorbed:** `AppGen` — Expo/React Native app scaffold (`expo`, `react-native`), not an Astro landing.

## Per-site development

```bash
cd sites/<name>
bun install
bun run dev    # or see site README
```

## Vercel Deployments

The following sites are configured for Vercel deployment. Each has a `vercel.json` at the site root:

| Site | Vercel Config | phenotype.space URL | Status |
|------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| `sites/tracera-landing` | ✓ `vercel.json` | `https://phenotype.space/tracera` | Astro + Bun |
| `sites/agileplus-landing` | ✓ `vercel.json` | `https://phenotype.space/agileplus` | Astro + Bun |
| `sites/byteport-landing` | ✓ `vercel.json` | `https://phenotype.space/byteport` | Astro + Bun |
| `sites/tokn-landing` | ✓ `vercel.json` | `https://phenotype.space/tokn` | Astro + Bun |

Each `vercel.json` specifies:
- `framework: "astro"`
- `buildCommand: "bun run build"`
- `outputDirectory: "dist"`
- `installCommand: "bun install"`

Deploy a site to Vercel:
```bash
cd sites/<name>
vercel --prod
```

Or connect the repo to Vercel Dashboard for automatic deployments on push to `main`.

## Root CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs Astro typecheck + build for the eight Bun/Astro packages under `sites/` on `main` and PRs.

## Subtree updates (optional)

To pull upstream from a source landing repo after merge:

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=sites/<name> https://github.com/KooshaPari/<name>.git main --squash
```
